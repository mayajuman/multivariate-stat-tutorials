Welcome to a basic tutorial on conducting (and plotting) multivariate morphometric analyses in R. Let's get started by loading in the packages we need:

```{r}
#load required packages
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggfortify)
library(MASS)
```

Next, let's load in our data. For this tutorial we'll be working with craniomandibular measurements from the Pen-tailed Treeshrew, *Ptilocercus lowii*. These data were previously published in Juman et al. 2021 (https://doi.org/10.1007/s10914-021-09556-7) and we will be recreating some of the analyses and plots from this study.

```{r}
#load in the supplementary data file from the paper, calling the correct sheet
anathana <- readxl::read_excel("Anathana supp data.xlsx",sheet="Anathana Data")

```

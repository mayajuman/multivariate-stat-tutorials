# Files
The RMarkdown files ("example analyses.Rmd" and "example mapping.Rmd") contain sample code for conducting/plotting analyses and producing locality maps, respectively. To follow the demonstration, load in the supplementary file from <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10914-021-09556-7" target="_blank">Juman et al. 2021</a>, which is also housed in this repository. Shape files for recreating the map from this study are stored in the IUCN range files folder.
